# Live-Music-Predictions
July 2020, Capstone Project for MS Data Analytics, CSU Global

With the future of live music in question during the midst of a global pandemic, the prediction of which bands are most successful in a live capacity would help companies that book live shows have the best chance of turning the most profit with limited opportunity.  With this in mind, I used South by Southwest and Spotify’s top streamed artists to develop a logistic regression model that will classify artists as more popular live or more popular streamed.  While there is some obvious overlap in that both sets of music, the resulting model is accurate within a 57-71% confidence interval.
